            At Hi Five, we understand that learning a new language can be
            challenging. That's why we provide private online English speaking
            sessions with our highly qualified instructors. Our platform is
            designed to give learners the flexibility to choose the number of
            minutes that best fits their schedule and practice at any time.
            After each session, we provide personalized feedback that includes
            corrections to grammar and pronunciation mistakes, as well as new
            vocabulary words to help our students improve their language skills.
            We are so confident in the quality of our instruction that
